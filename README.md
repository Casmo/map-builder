# Map Builder
A tool to make maps based in real world geo data. Goal is to be able to export this data to canvas 2D, Three JS and hopefully export it to 3D printers and laser cutters.

Build with Laravel, Vue JS, Tailwind and Inertia.

# Installation
`git clone`
`composer install`
`npm install`
`npm run watch`

You need to download and import geo data from places. See resources for more information.
